about_me_description: Hey there, I'm Parveen, a PhD student in Electrical Engineering at USF, diving deep into the fascinating world of biomedical. With nearly 5 years of tinkering with fNIRS experiments, m currently on a mission to unravel the mysteries of depth resolved cerebral blood flow using diffuse correlation spectroscopy devices. I've got a soft spot for history, embracing my inner geek, and I can binge-watch documentaries like it's an Olympic sport.  Colleagues describe me as resilient and open to trying new things. While I might not claim to be a genius, once I'm hooked on something, I like to see it through.Numbers have a special place in my heart; I revel in math problems like they're puzzles waiting to be solved.Did you know that hoods have Arabic roots, or that Adidas and Puma share a fraternal bond? I thrive on uncovering quirky facts like these. When I'm not in the lab, you'll find me cheering enthusiastically at live theaters or mastering the art of the violin. Oh, and I'm also a proud cat mom, ask me about my feline friend if you ever catch me in person. Life's a stage, and I'm here to live out every fantasy!
